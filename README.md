Momos Token Changer is a Module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop which adds a button onto the Token HUD if the specified token has ```Randomize Wildcard Images``` enabled and the specified path contains more than 1 image.

Clicking the button on the Token HUD opens a new panel which shows all of the images available in the Wildcard path, allowing for the player to select any of these images and change the appearance of their tokens without the hassle of opening the Token Configuration Panel.

The module is originally based off [FVTT-TokenHUBWildcard](https://github.com/javieros105/FVTT-TokenHUDWildcard) - re-written to work with Foundry V10.
